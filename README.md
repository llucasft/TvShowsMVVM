# TvShowsMVVM

I built this project with the goal of learning some essencial tools for Android development:
* Architecture (MVVM)
* Dependency Injection (Hilt)
* Api Requests (Retrofit)
* LiveData
* Navigation

##### Home Screen
The home screen of the app is the list of Tv Show that we get from the TV Maze API: https://www.tvmaze.com/api
